#ceph api client
This is a WIP for a API that upload and retrieve files from CEPH using the Swift API.

This is intented to serve concurrent/multiple requests at a time without degrading it's performance.

Security will be added using Keycloak sรณ we can store the Roles as metadata in the objects.

Testing...
